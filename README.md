# KatChat

[KatChat Live Demo!](https://kat-chat.herokuapp.com/#/login)

KatChat is a fullstack live messaging application designed after the popular gaming chat-app, Discord. KatChat is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend, and React and Redux on the frontend.  KatChat gives users the ability to create and join servers, create channels and message their friends! For live messaging, this app uses Rails' ActionCables, so that users may receive live messages without the need to refresh on the frontend.

- Ruby on Rails for the backend framework.
- PostgreSQL for the database.
- jQuery/ajax used for backend calls.
